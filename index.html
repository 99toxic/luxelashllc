        <h3>Before Your Appointment:</h3>
        <p>It is necessary to have clean lashes for the best retention possible.
          Refrain from wearing mascara or any eye makeup to your appointment.
          Refrain from using waterproof mascara three days prior as it leaves an oily residue
          that can affect retention.
          Refrain from caffeine three hours prior as it can make the lashes flutter and harder to lash.
          Avoid oils, glycols, cream based eyeshadows and eyeliners.
          Please inform your stylist of any known allergies.
          Please turn your phone on silent as a courtesy to everyone.
          Please do not bring kids unsupervised as your eyes will be closed the entire time. </p>
        <h3>During Your Appointment:</h3>
        <p>Refrain from opening your eyes while lashing is in progress.
          Minimal talking is advised to keep the eyelash pads in place.
          Inform your stylist if you experience any concerns.
          Lay still, relax, and feel free to ask for a blanket or bolster. </p>
        <h3>After Your Appointment:</h3>
        <div class="flex">
          <div>
            <h3>Don't</h3>
            <p>Do not get your lashes wet within the first 24 hours.
              No swimming, showers, facials, steam, tears, hot yoga, exercise
              or anything that induces perspiring.
              Do not spray tan for 24 hours after your appointment.
              No picking, pulling or rubbing your lashes.
              Donâ€™t apply mascara onto your eyelash extensions or use an eyelash curler.
              Avoid direct heat (i.e. hairdryers, grills, or ovens) </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Do</h3>
            <p>Use oil-free and glycol free products.
              Use the recommended lash cleanser as advised.
              Use your lash wand to brush gently through your lashes.
              Use a lash sealer to ensure better retention.
              Use a silk pillowcase or silk sleep mask while you sleep.
              We hope you love and enjoy your luxurious lashes! </p>

      <!--FAQ's-->
      <div id="faq">
        <h1>FAQ's</h1>
        <h3>What are eyelash extensions?</h3>
        <p>Eyelash extensions are a lightweight individual synthetic lash curled to look like a natural eyelash. They are thicker at the base and taper to fine point which adds length, curl, and thickness to your own lashes. They are individually applied one by one to your natural lashes using a semi-permanent bonding agent. Eyelash extensions is a very intricate service that requires precision and skill that requires a licensed and trained professional. At Luxe Lash we are licensed, trained and certified in multiple lash companies and have years of experience. We uphold the best standards in lash application and stand behind our meticulous work to provide the best in luxury eyelash services.</p>
        <h3>How long do eyelash extensions last?</h3>
        <p>Natural eyelashes have a life span and growth cycle. They grow to a specific length before shedding and the eyelash extensions will fall out along with your natural lash cycle. With proper care your eyelash extensions will last as long as your own natural eyelash, and are maintained with routine fills. To keep your lashes lush and full we recommend getting regular fills. We provide a variety of fills to suit your needs.</p>
        <h3>How often should I get fills?</h3>
        <p>Depending on your own lash growth and personal preference of fullness determines how frequently you will need fills. To keep your lashes looking their best it is important to maintain them with regular fills. We recommend every 2-3 weeks to keep your lashes lush and full.</p>
        <h3>Will it damage my natural lashes?</h3>
        <p>With proper application eyelash extensions will not damage your natural lashes. Your lashes are continuously shedding and grow back in 4-6 week cycles and the extension falls off with your natural lash cycle. At Luxe Lash we customize the extensions and safely apply them in appropriate lengths to ensure no damage to your natural lashes.</p>
        <h3>How long does it take? </h3>
        <p>A full set of eyelash extensions can take between 90-120 minutes. We offer lash fills in 30, 60, and 90 minute increments. Some prefer to come weekly for 30 minutes or bi-monthly for 60 and 90 minutes. If you desire the most fullness 90 minutes is recommended.</p>
        <h3>How do I know if I can wear eyelash extensions?</h3>
        <p>Almost anyone can enjoy the benefit of eyelash extensions but certain conditions can make them inappropriate for you. If one or more of the following conditions applies to you, you may not be a good candidate for eyelash extensions.</p>
        <h3>If You Rub Your Eyes Frequently:</h3>
        <p>If you suffer from seasonal allergies or just find you tend to rub your eyes excessively. We recommend no rubbing, picking or pulling.</p>
        <h3>Sensitive Skin:</h3>
        <p>Although eyelash extensions are NOT applied to the skin, allergic reactions are possible from the adhesive, under eye gel pads or the latex-free tape. Please inform your eyelash stylist if you have any allergies or if you have any possible skin irritations. </p>
        <h3>Lasik Eye Surgery:</h3>
        <p>You must wait at least 4 weeks and seek your doctorâ€™s approval prior to getting eyelash extensions.</p>
        <h3>Eyelift:</h3>
        <p>It is recommended to wait 4-6 months after the operation and seek a doctorâ€™s approval.</p>
        <h3>Medical Illnesses:</h3>
        <p>Common colds, sinus infections can cause irritation and/or eye secretions which can cause inadequate bonding of the adhesive and premature loss of your eyelash extensions. You suffer from other medical illnesses, or are undergoing chemotherapy or other medical treatments.</p>
        <h3>Conditions That Affect Eyelash Growth:</h3>
        <p>You have no natural eyelashes, or suffer from any conditions that affect eyelash growth. Since eyelashes extensions are applied to your own natural lashes you must have lashes in order to apply the extensions.</p>
        <h3>Thyroid Medication:</h3>
        <p>Wearing eyelash extensions could possibly be a challenge. Infills must be up kept since it can cause lash loss or weak lashes.</p>
        <h3>How Do I Care For Them?</h3>
        <p>It is necessary to brush your lashes and clean your lashes daily to prevent any eye irritation, infection, blepharitis or other eye health issues. We recommend using and retail an oil-free lash and makeup cleanser to keep your lashes healthy and clean. Please follow the recommended after-care instructions as advised.</p>
        <h3>What is Sealer?</h3>
        <p>Sealer helps cure the adhesive bonds of your eyelash extensions, aids in the longevity of your extensions as well as nourishing your natural lashes. We recommend applying daily and also 30 minutes prior to any outdoor or physical activities and sun exposure.</p>
        <h3>Can The Extensions Be Removed?</h3>
        <p>Yes. If you find you need or would like them removed we use a specially formulated gel remover to safely dissolve the adhesive bonds. Please do not attempt to remove them on your own as this can cause damage to your natural eyelashes.</p>
